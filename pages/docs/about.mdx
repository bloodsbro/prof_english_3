# About the Project

This project is aimed at developing a **web application for delivery management** using **Nuxt.js**. It integrates a backend API with **OpenAPI** documentation and utilizes **Zudoku** for visualizing the API endpoints.

## Key Features:
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Users can register and log in to manage their deliveries securely.
- **Delivery Management**: Users can create, track, and update the status of their deliveries.
- **Courier Interaction**: Couriers can accept orders and update delivery statuses.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrators can manage users, couriers, and delivery orders.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Both users and couriers receive updates on delivery statuses.

## Technologies Used:
- **Nuxt.js**: A framework based on Vue.js for building the frontend.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for the backend server.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for secure authentication.
- **OpenAPI**: For creating RESTful API documentation.
- **Zudoku**: To view and interact with API documentation.

## Future Plans:
- **Mobile App Support**: We plan to extend the web app to mobile platforms for better user experience.
- **Geolocation**: Adding geolocation tracking for delivery status and couriers.
- **Push Notifications**: Real-time notifications for users and couriers regarding their orders.

This project aims to streamline the delivery process for both users and businesses, providing an easy-to-use interface and robust back-end features.
